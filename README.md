# OIBSIP-3
## NAME: KAMPA VASU
## DOMAIN: INFORMATION SCINCE
# AIM:
The Aim of the task is to calculate body mass index using height and weight.
# DESCRIPTION:
This Python script is a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator. BMI is a measure of body fat based on an individual's weight and height. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Function Definitions:

calculate_bmi(weight, height): Takes weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters) as input and calculates the BMI using the formula BMI = weight / (height^2).
classify_bmi(bmi): Takes the calculated BMI as input and classifies it into different categories such as "Underweight," "Normal Weight," "Overweight," or "Obese" based on standard BMI ranges.
Main Function (main()):

Prompts the user to input their weight in kilograms and height in meters.
Converts the input to floating-point numbers and calculates the BMI using the calculate_bmi function.
Classifies the calculated BMI into a category using the classify_bmi function.
Prints the calculated BMI and its corresponding category.
Script Execution:

When the script is executed, it prompts the user to enter their weight and height.
It calculates the BMI and classifies it into a category.
The script then prints the calculated BMI and its corresponding category.
Usage:

Users can run the script and input their weight and height to get their BMI and corresponding weight category (e.g., "Normal Weight," "Overweight").
The script provides a basic assessment of body weight based on the BMI value and predefined categories.
